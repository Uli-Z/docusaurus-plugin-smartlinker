# Log

## Summary
- Replaced SmartLink/Tooltip base styles with Infima-backed variables and state rules, dropping bespoke inheritance overrides.
- Updated tooltip runtime to push the max-width through a CSS custom property so the stylesheet can control it via Infima tokens.
- Documented the new token mapping and kept CHANGELOG notes for the alignment work.

## Verification
- pnpm build
- pnpm test
