# Clostridioides difficile

Clostridioides difficile is a spore-forming anaerobe often abbreviated as Cdiff.
In the demo dataset it represents how pathogen alerts can be woven into everyday
clinical documentation.

:::danger Transmission risk
Cdiff spores persist in the environment and can spread rapidly across inpatient units.
Early detection in free-text notes helps infection-control teams respond quickly.

## Auto-link behaviour

- Any mention of **Cdiff** or the full organism name links here for deeper guidance.
- The inline preview highlights that it is an anaerobic, Gram-positive rod.
- Icons attached to the link draw attention to the infection risk level.

## Response checklist

1. Initiate contact precautions immediately when Cdiff is suspected.
2. Send stool samples for toxin assay confirmation.
3. Review current antimicrobial therapy â€” especially agents such as Amoxicillin
   that predispose patients to Cdiff infection.

These steps show how automatic linking keeps situational awareness high without
burdening authors with formatting work.
