# Explore Auto-Link Examples

The Smartlinker plugin automatically turns free text into a connected knowledge base.
This page highlights several ways the demo content reacts when the plugin is enabled.

:::info Live demo content
Every example on this page uses the same vocabulary configuration that powers the plugin.
Each highlighted term is transformed into a contextual link when the page renders.

## Use cases at a glance

<Tabs groupId="usecase">
  <TabItem value="antibiotic" label="Antibiotic monographs">
    Clinicians browsing dosing information can jump straight into the
    <Link to="/docs/antibiotics/amoxicillin">Amoxicillin reference</Link> by
    clicking either **Amoxicillin** or its common abbreviation **Amoxi** inside
    any note or guideline.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pathogen" label="Pathogen warnings">
    Infection-control teams are warned when **Clostridioides difficile** is
    mentioned.
    The plugin links every occurrence of the bacterium — even the shortened
    **Cdiff** form — to the <Link to="/docs/bacteria/cdiff">pathogen sheet</Link>.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="smart" label="SmartLink walkthrough">
    Training material such as the <Link to="/docs/smartlink-demo">SmartLink demo</Link>
    shows how both organisms and drugs become interactive without adding manual
    markup to the source documents.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Inline auto-link demo

As soon as content writers mention Amoxi for a patient, the plugin resolves it to the
complete Amoxicillin entry.
If a lab report later confirms Clostridioides difficile, the same note contains a
link to up-to-date treatment guidelines — no additional authoring steps required.

:::tip Hover the links
Hovering a linked word displays the rich preview configured for that concept.
Try it on either **Amoxicillin** or **Cdiff** in this section to see the inline metadata.
