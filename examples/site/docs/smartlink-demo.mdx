description: Draft notes on how the auto-link plugin behaves inside the antibiotic guideline example.
---

:::note Draft status
This page is a working sketch for the Smartlinker plugin. The data is fictional and the behaviour may change once the tooling stabilises.
:::

## Guideline scenario

The infectious diseases team keeps a lightweight antibiotic guideline. When a note says "Continue Amoxi for five days," the plugin links to the amoxicillin profile. If the same entry later mentions Clostridioides difficile, a second link points to the pathogen summary. No manual markup is added to the markdown files.

> Continue Amoxi for five days while sensitivities are pending.  
> Reassess if signs of Clostridioides difficile infection appear.

### Terms resolved at the moment

- **Amoxi** and **Amoxicillin** route to the [antibiotic reference](/docs/antibiotics/amoxicillin).
- **Cdiff** and **Clostridioides difficile** route to the [pathogen overview](/docs/bacteria/cdiff).
- References to the **SmartLink walkthrough** stay on this page for training purposes.

## Tooltip behaviour

Each destination document can define a short note that appears on hover. The amoxicillin entry currently uses Markdown mixed with a `DrugTip` React component:

```mdx title="docs/linkify-test.mdx"
---
auto-link-short-note: |
  **Aminopenicillin.** Offers good oral bioavailability.
  <DrugTip note="Take with food" />
---
```

Because the tooltip content is compiled as MDX, the bold text and `<DrugTip>` component render inside the preview without extra wiring.

## Icon signals

Icons are configured globally in `docusaurus.config.ts` and referenced from the document front matter. In this draft:

- `pill` displays a pill emoji for drug monographs.
- `bug` points to a simple SVG for pathogen sheets.
- Documents without a matching icon fall back to the default icon defined in the plugin options.

The icon sits to the right of the link text to keep the prose readable.

## Markdown coverage

The remark plugin runs on every docs and pages pipeline, so auto-linking applies to more than plain paragraphs. A few examples that rely on the same index:

| Surface | Sample content |
| --- | --- |
| Checklist | 1. Continue **Amoxicillin** until day five. <br />2. Monitor for **Cdiff** symptoms. |
| Table cell | `Suspected pathogen` → **Clostridioides difficile** |
| Admonition | :::tip Hover the links<br />The **Amoxi** entry exposes dosing hints via the tooltip.<br />::: |

## Opting out for specific files

Set `linkify: false` in a document’s front matter if it should remain untouched:

```mdx
---
id: experimental-note
slug: /internal/experimental
linkify: false
---
```

This is useful for drafts or administrative pages that reuse terminology without needing cross-links.

## Known gaps

This walkthrough only reflects the limited dataset in the example site. The plugin has not been exercised against real guideline material yet, so expect incomplete vocabulary coverage and potential performance issues in larger collections.
