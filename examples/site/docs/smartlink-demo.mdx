# SmartLink Demo

This walkthrough illustrates how a single paragraph referencing Amoxi and Cdiff is
instantly upgraded with contextual links.

## Step-by-step tour

1. Authors write natural language instructions that mention treatments and pathogens.
2. The Linkify-Med plugin scans the text, matching terms such as **Amoxicillin** or **Cdiff**.
3. Matching phrases are wrapped with rich links that surface icons, quick notes, and
   shortcut navigation to deeper documentation.

:::tip No manual markup required
The underlying Markdown files remain clean. The plugin injects links and previews
on the fly based on your vocabulary configuration.

## Combined example

> Continue Amoxi for 5 days and monitor closely for signs of Clostridioides difficile.

In the published site, the snippet above produces two interactive anchors â€” one for the
antibiotic and another for the infection. Readers can then jump into the related
reference sheets for dosing recommendations or infection-control protocols.
