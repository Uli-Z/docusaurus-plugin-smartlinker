This demo shows how terms like Amoxi and Cdiff automatically link to their reference pages.

Hover the highlighted terms to see Markdown-formatted tooltips that also render the custom `<DrugTip>` component registered via the plugin options.

The tooltip for **Amoxi** is defined in the drug entry front matter and mixes Markdown with the `<DrugTip>` React component:

```mdx title="docs/linkify-test.mdx"
---
shortNote: |
  **Aminopenicillin.** Offers good oral bioavailability.
  <DrugTip note="Take with food" />
---
```

Hover the Amoxi link above to see the rendered component inside the tooltip.
