# Amoxicillin reference

Amoxicillin is one of the standard examples used by the plugin to demonstrate
how drug monographs can be cross-linked without manual HTML.

:::note Quick summary
**Class:** Aminopenicillin  \\
**Administration routes:** Oral or intravenous  \\
**Auto-link triggers:** Amoxi, Amoxicillin
:::

## Typical auto-link triggers

- Clinical shorthand such as **Amoxi** in a discharge note.
- The full name **Amoxicillin** inside therapeutic guidelines.
- Mentions embedded in a dosage table or formulary export.

Whenever a match is detected, the text becomes an interactive link that reuses
this document's metadata and iconography.

## Example scenario

A pediatric rounding note that reads "Continue Amoxi for 5 days" will automatically
link to this page, giving prescribers fast access to dosage adjustments.
If the same patient develops symptoms concerning for Cdiff, the note will
feature two contextual links: one for the antibiotic and one for the pathogen profile.

## Additional metadata

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Spectrum | Gram-positive coverage with limited Gram-negative activity |
| Adjustment | Required in renal impairment |
| Related organisms | *Helicobacter pylori*, *Streptococcus pneumoniae* |

These details illustrate how the plugin can surface quick facts directly from the
knowledge graph while keeping authors focused on the clinical narrative.
