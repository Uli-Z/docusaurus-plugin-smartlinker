## Overview

Smartlinker is a Docusaurus v3 plugin that turns documented terms into context-aware links with tooltip previews. The repository is a pnpm workspace that produces the `docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker` npm package, an example Docusaurus site, and automation around build, packaging, and smoke verification. Packaging is driven by a single tsup configuration that emits both ESM and CJS bundles plus type declarations (including the remark helper) from the plugin workspace.

Primary deliverables:
- `docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker` npm package (plugin + remark helper + runtime theme assets bundled via tsup).
- Example site under `examples/site` showcasing integration and serving as a smoke test subject.
- CI pipelines that run builds, tests, packing, and site verification on Node 20 with pnpm.
- GitHub Pages deployment of the example site on pushes to `main`/`work`.
- Release tarballs attached to GitHub Releases for consumers that install directly from `.tgz` artifacts.

## System Architecture

Smartlinker operates in three phases:
1. **Build-time indexing** (`packages/docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker/src/node`): scans configured folders, parses front matter, and compiles tooltip MDX via the pipeline in `buildPipeline.ts`.
2. **Remark transform** (`packages/docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker/src/remark`): rewrites Markdown/MDX nodes to inject SmartLink references, reusing the same debug configuration set by the plugin entry point.
3. **Runtime/theme layer** (`packages/docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker/src/theme`): renders the tooltip component tree, pulls registry data from Docusaurus global data, and exposes CSS variables aligned with Infima tokens.

Generated artifacts are emitted to `packages/docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker/dist/`, where the tsup bundle produces `index.{mjs,cjs}` for the plugin and `remark/index.{mjs,cjs}` for the remark helper alongside declaration files and the compiled theme runtime.

## Components & Repositories

- [`package.json`](package.json): private workspace root targeting Node `>=18 <25`, configured with pnpm 9. Scripts proxy to the plugin workspace (`build`, `test`, `typecheck`), example site helpers (`site:*`), packaging (`pack:ci` which shells into the plugin workspace), and the tarball smoke harness (`smoke:git-install`).
- [`packages/docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker`](packages/docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker): publishable package with TypeScript sources, `tsup.config.ts` for dual-format bundling, `scripts/postbuild-verify.mjs` to enforce dist integrity, Vitest configuration, and tracked `dist/` artifacts. The workspace now owns its README and MIT license so the published tarball is self-contained. Its `pack:ci` script performs a clean build and `pnpm pack` so packaging may be driven directly from the workspace (the root script delegates here).
- [`packages/remark-smartlinker`](packages/remark-smartlinker): legacy workspace retained for tests and TypeScript sources; runtime bundles are emitted from the plugin’s `dist/remark`. Keep until the layout is simplified.
- [`examples/site`](examples/site): Docusaurus project consuming the plugin via a workspace `link:` dependency. Commands are proxied through root `site:*` scripts.
- [`scripts`](scripts): currently houses `git-install-smoke.mjs`, which packs the repository, rewrites the example site dependency to the generated tarball, installs, and triggers `docusaurus build`.
- [`.github/workflows`](.github/workflows): CI workflow (`ci.yml`) performing pnpm-based validation on Node 20 and Pages deployment (`deploy-example-site.yml`).
- [`README.md`](README.md), [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md), and [`RELEASE_NOTES.md`](RELEASE_NOTES.md): user-facing quick start, operations guide, and release history.

## Dependencies & Tooling

Core prerequisites:
- Node.js `^18.18 || ^20 || ^22` (see `engines` in `package.json`).
- pnpm 9 (activated via Corepack); npm remains a supported consumer path for published tarballs.
- TypeScript 5.5+ (local dependency for builds).
- tsup 8.x for bundle generation (`packages/docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker/tsup.config.ts`).
- Vitest 2.x for unit tests (configured in `packages/docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker/vitest.config.ts`).
- Docusaurus v3 peer dependencies (`@docusaurus/core`, `react`, `react-dom`, `unified`) for consumers and the example site.

Helpful utilities:
- `corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@9.0.0 --activate` to align pnpm version with the repo and CI.
- `pnpm pack` (wrapped by `pnpm run pack:ci` and the smoke script) to generate distributable tarballs.
- `rimraf` is bundled in the plugin workspace for cross-platform cleanups during builds.

## Local Development Setup

1. **Install toolchain**
   ```bash
   corepack enable
   corepack prepare pnpm@9.0.0 --activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
   This bootstraps all workspaces, including the example site.

3. **Build the plugin**
   ```bash
   pnpm run build
   ```
   The root script delegates to `packages/docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker`, which cleans previous artifacts, runs `tsc` into `dist-tsc`, bundles `index` and `remark/index` with tsup (producing `.mjs`/`.cjs` plus declarations), copies the theme assets, and removes transient outputs via `scripts/postbuild-verify.mjs`.

4. **Run validation scripts**
   ```bash
   pnpm run pack:ci          # packs the plugin workspace into build-artifacts/*.tgz
   pnpm run smoke:git-install # optional: tarball smoke test against a temp copy of the example site
   ```

5. **Example site workflows**
   ```bash
   pnpm run site:dev       # docusaurus start (requires a recent pnpm run build)
   pnpm run site:build     # docusaurus build
   pnpm run site:serve     # serves build output
   ```
   The example site depends on the plugin through `link:../../packages/docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker`, so ensure the plugin has been built before running `site:build` or `site:dev`.

6. **Testing**
   ```bash
   pnpm test                 # rebuilds and executes the plugin Vitest suite
   pnpm --filter docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker run test   # run tests without the root pre-build if needed
   ```
   **Note:** Vitest still crashes under Node 22 due to tinypool worker errors. Use Node 20 until upstream fixes land.

## Build & Packaging

### Build outputs
- `packages/docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker/dist/index.{mjs,cjs}` — plugin entry points for ESM/CJS consumers.
- `packages/docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker/dist/index.d.ts` (and `.d.cts`) — bundled type declarations for the plugin entry.
- `packages/docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker/dist/remark/index.{mjs,cjs}` — remark helper entry points emitted from the same workspace.
- `packages/docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker/dist/remark/index.d.ts` (and `.d.cts`) — remark helper declarations.
- `packages/docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker/dist/theme/**/*` — runtime components and CSS copied from `src/theme/styles.css`.
- Tarballs generated via `pnpm pack` (root or plugin workspace) contain README, LICENSE, and the dist assets required by consumers.

The plugin TypeScript project is configured with `moduleResolution: "nodenext"` so the shared remark sources (which live in `packages/remark-smartlinker`) can be re-exported with explicit `.js` extensions while still producing `.d.ts` bundles for both entrypoints.

`postbuild-verify.mjs` ensures the required files exist, copies theme assets, enforces explicit relative import extensions, and removes legacy single-format outputs (`dist/index.js`, `dist/remark/index.js`) before cleaning the `dist-tsc` staging directory.

### Commands
```bash
pnpm -C packages/docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker run build      # clean + TypeScript compile + tsup bundle + postbuild verification
pnpm -C packages/docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker run pack:ci    # clean build + pnpm pack -> workspace tarball
pnpm run pack:ci                                               # root proxy: wipes build-artifacts/ and calls workspace pack:ci
pnpm run smoke:git-install                                      # packs repository and runs a Docusaurus build from the tarball
pnpm --filter docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker pack                # direct pack for ad-hoc tarball creation
```

The root README recommends installing the published `.tgz` directly from GitHub Releases (matching the versioned tarballs produced by these commands).

### Versioning strategy
- The plugin follows semantic versioning; current version is `0.1.0` (`packages/docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker/package.json`). Update the workspace version before publishing.
- Keep `CHANGELOG.md` up to date per release. Update `RELEASE_NOTES.md` with highlights for user-facing communication.
- Align npm tags (`latest` vs `next`) manually when publishing (see [Release Process](#release-process)).

### Containerization & Distribution
- No container images are produced today. Distribution is via the npm registry (`docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker` package) and GitHub-release tarballs.
- Document container strategies here if future smoke or CI flows require them (TODO).

## Deployment

### Environments
| Environment | Purpose | Entry point | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------------|-------|
| Local dev | Develop plugin and run example site | Developer workstation | Run `pnpm run build` before `site:*` commands |
| CI | Validate builds/tests/smoke | GitHub Actions (`ci.yml`) | Node 20 + pnpm; runs typecheck, tests, build, site build, pack:ci |
| Production docs | Publish example site | GitHub Pages (`deploy-example-site.yml`) | Triggered on push to `main`/`work` |
| Package distribution | Publish npm releases | npm registry | Manual `npm publish` from the package directory |

### Example site deployment (GitHub Pages)
1. Workflow `.github/workflows/deploy-example-site.yml` installs with pnpm, runs `pnpm run build`, `pnpm run site:build`, uploads `examples/site/build`, and deploys via `actions/deploy-pages@v4`.
2. Infrastructure: GitHub-managed Pages environment (`github-pages`). No additional provisioning required.
3. Secrets: uses the repository-provided `GITHUB_TOKEN`; no custom secrets are needed.
4. Migrations: none. Changes to routing/content ship with new commits.
5. Rollout strategy: workflow is idempotent; verify by visiting the URL from the deployment summary (`steps.deployment.outputs.page_url`).
6. Rollback: re-run the workflow on an earlier commit or redeploy via the Pages history.

### Package publishing
1. Ensure working tree is clean and `pnpm run build`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm run pack:ci`, and the smoke harness pass.
2. Bump the version inside `packages/docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker/package.json` (`pnpm --filter docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker version <major|minor|patch>` or edit manually).
3. Publish:
   ```bash
   cd packages/docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker
   npm publish --access public
   ```
4. Tag the release in git and push tags.
5. Post-release verification: install the freshly published version in a sample project or rerun the tarball smoke script against the registry tarball.
6. Rollback plan: if a critical issue ships, deprecate the npm version (`npm deprecate`) and publish a patched release.

## Configuration & Secrets

- **Plugin options**: Configured inside consumer `docusaurus.config.*`. Reference implementation in the README `Quick start` block and `examples/site/docusaurus.config.ts`.
- **Environment variables**:
  - `DOCUSAURUS_PLUGIN_DEBUG` / `DOCUSAURUS_PLUGIN_DEBUG_LEVEL` control logging verbosity (see `README.md`).
  - Example site honors `SITE_URL` and `SITE_BASE_URL` to customize deployment base paths (`examples/site/docusaurus.config.ts`).
  - GitHub Actions supply `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` and `GITHUB_ACTIONS` for dynamic config during Pages deploys.
- **Secrets**: None stored in-repo. GitHub Pages uses built-in OIDC + `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Document any future secrets here.
- **Tooltip component overrides**: Provide module paths via `tooltipComponents` entries in plugin options; aggregated in `src/options.ts`.

## CI/CD

- **Workflow**: [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)
  - Triggered on pushes to `main`, pull requests, and manual dispatch.
  - Runs on Node 20 with pnpm 9.
  - Steps: checkout → setup pnpm → install (`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`) → `pnpm typecheck` → `pnpm test` (build + vitest) → `pnpm run build` (ensures dist refreshed post-tests) → `pnpm run site:build` → `pnpm run pack:ci` → upload dist folders and tarballs.
- **Pages Deploy**: [`.github/workflows/deploy-example-site.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy-example-site.yml)
  - Triggered on push to `main` and `work`, plus manual dispatch.
  - Builds packages and example site with pnpm before uploading to GitHub Pages.
- **Release Tarball**: [`.github/workflows/release-tarball.yml`](.github/workflows/release-tarball.yml)
  - Triggered on version tags (`v*`) or manual dispatch.
  - Installs with pnpm 9, builds the plugin workspace, runs `pnpm pack`, and uploads the generated tarball (plus a `-latest` alias) to the GitHub Release created for the tag.
- **Status checks**: Ensure both workflows stay green before merging or tagging releases.

## Observability & Troubleshooting

- **Debug logging**: Set `DOCUSAURUS_PLUGIN_DEBUG=1` and optionally `DOCUSAURUS_PLUGIN_DEBUG_LEVEL=trace` when running Docusaurus builds to surface structured logs from `src/logger.ts`.
- **Smoke artifacts**: `pnpm run smoke:git-install` logs the temporary workspace paths during execution; capture the console output if you need to inspect the generated site.
- **CI logs**: GitHub Actions logs capture pnpm output. Re-run jobs with debug logging enabled if necessary (`ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG=true`).
- **Common failures**:
  - Vitest tinypool crash on Node 22 (`pnpm test`); workaround: use Node 20.
  - Example site build failing with missing `dist` assets: run `pnpm run build` before invoking `pnpm run site:build`.
  - Tarball verification issues: ensure `pnpm run pack:ci` completed after a fresh build so the bundle includes the remark helper and theme assets.

## Security & Compliance

- License: MIT (`LICENSE` and `packages/docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker/LICENSE`).
- Dependency overrides: root `package.json` enforces patched versions of React, estree utilities, and `zod`. Review periodically for updates.
- npm audit: CI does not currently run `npm audit`; run manually if needed (`pnpm audit` / `npm audit`).
- Secrets management: no secrets stored locally. Future secrets should use GitHub Actions Encrypted Secrets with least privilege.

## Example Site Integration

- Managed under [`examples/site`](examples/site) with scripts proxied via root `package.json`:
  ```bash
  pnpm run site:dev       # docusaurus start
  pnpm run site:build     # docusaurus build
  pnpm run site:serve     # serves build output
  ```
- The workspace dependency uses `link:../../packages/docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker`, so `pnpm install` keeps it in sync. Rebuild the plugin (`pnpm run build`) whenever source changes before starting dev or build commands.
- Configuration references the remark helper via `remarkSmartlinker` import and registers tooltip components (see `examples/site/docusaurus.config.ts`).
- Environment toggles (`SITE_URL`, `SITE_BASE_URL`) control deployment paths for GitHub Pages vs local dev.

## Release Process

1. Update documentation (`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`) and changelog entries (`packages/docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker/CHANGELOG.md`, root `CHANGELOG.md`).
2. Verify CI is green or replicate locally:
   ```bash
   pnpm run build
   pnpm test        # prefer Node 20 until tinypool issue resolved
   pnpm run pack:ci
   pnpm run smoke:git-install
   pnpm run site:build
   ```
3. Bump version (`pnpm --filter docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker version patch` etc.) in `packages/docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker`.
4. Publish to npm (`npm publish --access public` from the package directory).
5. Tag commit and push: `git push origin main --tags`.
6. Draft release notes referencing `RELEASE_NOTES.md`; upload the tarball to the GitHub Release if publishing outside npm.
7. Post-release: run the smoke script against the published package or install the registry tarball in a demo project.

## Known Issues & Limitations

- `pnpm test` fails under Node 22 due to tinypool worker crashes. Workaround: switch to Node 20 (`nvm use 20`) until upstream fix lands.
- Vitest suites still emit verbose Docusaurus debug output; consider toggling `DOCUSAURUS_PLUGIN_DEBUG=0` inside tests when stabilizing.
- `packages/remark-smartlinker` remains a placeholder workspace; consolidate once tests move under the primary package.
- No automated link checker exists for this documentation; review links manually during updates.

## Roadmap & Backlog

- Track issues and enhancements on GitHub: <https://github.com/Uli-Z/docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker/issues>.
- See `RELEASE_NOTES.md` for historical context and upcoming maintenance notes.
- Future ideas (capture as GitHub issues): stabilize Vitest suites, introduce registry-based smoke tests, and formalize container-based CI.

## Glossary

- **SmartLink**: React component that renders link + tooltip for a documented term.
- **Short Note**: MDX snippet compiled into tooltip content via `smartlink-short-note` front matter.
- **Registry**: Generated dataset mapping term IDs to metadata, emitted under `dist/registry` and loaded via Docusaurus global data.
- **Smoke Test**: Automated end-to-end check that packs the plugin, installs it into a fresh example site, and runs `docusaurus build` (`scripts/git-install-smoke.mjs`).
- **Tarball Verification**: `pnpm pack`-based inspection ensuring the generated package contains required files and no workspace protocols (enforced indirectly by `postbuild-verify.mjs` and smoke tests).
- **Example Site**: Docusaurus project in `examples/site` used for demos and smoke coverage.
- **DOCUSAURUS_PLUGIN_DEBUG**: Environment flag enabling plugin debug logging with levels defined in `src/logger.ts`.
