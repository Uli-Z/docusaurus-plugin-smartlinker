# docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker

Smartlinker is a Docusaurus v3 plugin (with an accompanying remark helper) that turns frontmatter metadata into automatic cross-links. By indexing each document's `id`, `slug`, synonyms, icon, and short note, it renders consistent SmartLinks with contextual tooltips wherever those terms appear in Markdown or MDX.

## Features at a glance

- **Frontmatter-driven linking.** Scan `id`, `slug`, `smartlink-terms`, optional `smartlink-icon`, and optional `smartlink-short-note` fields and keep the registry in sync with your filesystem.
- **Tooltip notes compiled from MDX.** Convert `smartlink-short-note` snippets into ready-to-render React components so domain tips appear inline in the tooltip.
- **Collision-aware registry generation.** Build a tooltip registry that resolves slug collisions based on folder proximity while preserving deterministic output.
- **Single `<SmartLink/>` component everywhere.** Inject the runtime so docs, pages, admonitions, and tables all share the same tooltip behavior (including emoji or SVG icons and dark-mode styling).
- **Remark plugin parity.** Bundle a remark transformer so Markdown handled outside of the Docusaurus plugin (e.g., classic preset docs/pages) receives identical SmartLink treatment.

## Quick start

1. **Install the package** (ships prebuilt via the root `prepare` script):

   ```bash
   npm install github:Uli-Z/docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker
   ```

2. **Register the plugins** in your `docusaurus.config.js`. The Docusaurus plugin now publishes its index automatically, so the remark transformer can be added without extra wiring:

   ```js
   import remarkSmartlinker from 'docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker/remark';

   export default {
     presets: [
       [
         'classic',
         {
           docs: {
             remarkPlugins: [remarkSmartlinker],
           },
           pages: {
             remarkPlugins: [remarkSmartlinker],
           },
         },
       ],
     ],
     plugins: [
       [
         'docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker',
         {
           slugPrefix: '/docs',
           icons: {
             pill: 'emoji:ðŸ’Š',
             bug: '/img/bug.svg',
           },
           defaultIcon: 'pill',
           tooltipComponents: {
             DrugTip: '@site/src/components/DrugTip',
           },
         },
       ],
     ],
   };
   ```

   The optional `slugPrefix` controls the base route that Smartlinker
   prepends to every frontmatter `slug` when it publishes the index for the
   remark transformer. Keep it aligned with the path where your docs mount
   (e.g., `routeBasePath: '/docs'`) so an entry with
   ``slug: /antibiotics/amoxicillin`` resolves to
   `/docs/antibiotics/amoxicillin` when Markdown is processed outside of
   Docusaurus. Omitting the option leaves the slugs untouched. The prefix
   does **not** filter which pages land in the index â€“ any file with
   `linkify !== false`, a non-empty `smartlink-terms` array, and valid
   `id`/`slug` metadata is included regardless of this setting.

3. **Annotate your docs** with SmartLink metadata so the index provider can pick up synonyms, icons, and tooltip notes:

   ```mdx
   ---
   id: amoxicillin
   slug: /antibiotics/amoxicillin
   smartlink-terms:
     - Amoxi
     - Amoxicillin
   smartlink-icon: pill
   smartlink-short-note: |
     **Aminopenicillin.** Offers good oral bioavailability.
     <DrugTip note="Take with food" />
   ---
   ```

If you're processing Markdown outside of the Docusaurus lifecycle, you can still create and pass a manual index provider via `createFsIndexProvider({ roots, slugPrefix })` when calling the remark transformer.

Smartlinker builds a registry from these front matter fields, injects `<SmartLink/>` nodes during the remark phase, and renders hover/tap tooltips at runtime.

## Packages

This repository publishes a single installable package:

- `docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker` â€“ the Docusaurus plugin itself, including the SmartLink theme components, filesystem-based index provider utilities, and a remark helper exposed from `docusaurus-plugin-smartlinker/remark`.

The workspaces in `packages/` house the source code for the plugin and the remark transform. They build into `dist/` and are included in the published tarball via the root `prepare` script.

## Solved coding challenges

Smartlinker tackles the tricky pieces required for automatic cross-linking in Docusaurus:

- **Robust frontmatter loader.** Uses `gray-matter` plus `zod` validation to normalize metadata and emit actionable warnings instead of crashing on malformed content.
- **Path distance & collision resolution.** Computes proximity scores between files so the closest document wins when multiple entries expose the same synonym.
- **Deterministic tooltip codegen.** Compiles MDX `smartlink-short-note` blocks into SSR-safe TSX modules and materializes a registry that can be imported by both the plugin runtime and the remark transformer.
- **Icon resolver with dark-mode awareness.** Validates configuration, applies defaults, and maps emoji or SVG assets consistently across the build outputs.
- **Synonym-aware remark transform.** Walks Markdown/MDX ASTs to replace matched text with `<SmartLink/>` nodes while preserving existing formatting.
- **Docusaurus SSR compatibility.** Keeps the build pipeline compatible with Webpack's server rendering requirements (e.g., avoiding root-level `"type": "module"`) so the example site and plugin compile cleanly.

## Verification scripts

- `npm run smoke:git-install` packs the repository, installs it into a temporary copy of the example site using `npm install <tarball>`, and runs `npm run build` to verify the Git install path succeeds end to end.
- `npm run site:build` (from the repo root) builds the included example site in `examples/site`.

## Example site

The `examples/site` workspace is a small Docusaurus project that exercises the SmartLink pipeline. It can be used for manual QA:

```bash
npm install
npm run build --workspace @examples/site
npm run serve --workspace @examples/site
```
